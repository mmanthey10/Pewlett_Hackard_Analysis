# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to analyze staffing levels within the company to determine the effect of upcoming retirements from senior staff members.

## Results and Summary
* Total number of employees eligible for retirement: 90,398
* The titles with the most employees eligible to retire are: Senior Engineer (29,415), Senior Staff (28,255)
* The titles with the least anticipated turnover due to retirement are: Manager (2), Assistant Engineer (1,761), Technique Leader (4,502).
* The company has a significantly lower portion of employees that are eligible to mentor junior employees, which may create challenges in providing adequate training internally.


## Two additional queries that would be useful
* Create buckets for employees by experience level to determine scale of employees that would be good candidate to promote internally.
* Query the number of mentor eligible employees for each title as well as the number of junior level employees for each title to determine if the company can support internal training with current staffing levels.
